# Bicep Gamers

Bicep Gamers (BG) is a fitness application that helps gamers exercise and take breaks in between games to preserve longevity. It recommends the user a resting portion and an exercising portion. The exercising portion is further aided with recommended exercises and instructional videos for the exercises.

The app works by starting a new session when the user starts gaming. When the user requests a break, the app recommends a break based on start session time. The recommended break is split into two uneven portions: The resting and the exercising portions: 

1. The exercising portion of the break is filled with recommended exercises and instructional videos for each exercise. The user can either select default exercises or customized exercises that fit into the exercising portion of the break.

2. The resting portion of the break is aided with recommendations to avoid screen time. The user has the freedom to end the break early and end the session itself. The user is also not restricted to take a break at set times. It can request the app for a break when needed but, the app does recommend taking a break if the user has not requested a break for prolonged periods.

The main target audience of the application is gamers. Gamers can easily implement this app into their routine because finishing a game is a natural cue to take a break. After a game, a gamer can request to take a break. The resting portion is time away from the screen but the exercising portion can also take place while the gamer is waiting in queue to get into the next game. This app aims to reduce the health conditions and frustrations involved with competitive gaming. 

There has been an ease of access for computer devices in recent years and a great number of individuals have been attracted to esports. Professional gamers practice up to 12 hours a day. While dedication like this has contributed to the growth of the e-sport industry, the number of gamers, especially the younger generation, with issues related to health conditions due to gaming has also increased. Gamers sit and use unnatural wrist positions for an extended period. This can lead to back issues and bad posture. Twisting wrists inwards to type and use the mouse can lead to wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Our app aims to reduce the severity of these conditions by recommending light exercises that specifically target these muscle groups. Taking breaks also improves gaming performance. Our app aims to reduce tilt by providing light exercises to relax the user prior to entering each game.
This application will be considered a success based on three criteria:

1. Improving gamer performance

2. Improving gaming health

3. Returning users 

Improving gamer performance can be assessed with comparing their W/L record. Improving gamer health can be assessed with a survey that inquiries if gamers have reduced wrist pain, improved posture, and/or better mood while gaming. We will also conduct a survey on the likelihood of continued use of the app. This survey will not only indicate the conventionality of the app but also indicate if the app has become mundane after continuous use.

# Branching strategy 
Our team will use Git flow as the branching strategy. There will be a master branch and a development branch. For every new feature, it will be worked in branches taken from the development branch. When a branch is finished, it is merged back into the development branch. For the release branch, we created it from the development branch, and then further to the hotfix branch if required. When everything has been checked, the content will be pushed to the master branch.

The main reason for choosing this strategy is that it has a separate development branch so it is more stable and clear than the github flow.
